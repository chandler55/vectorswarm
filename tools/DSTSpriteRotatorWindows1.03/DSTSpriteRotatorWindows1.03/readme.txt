Instructions:

Simply enter a filename, and press enter. You will see
a preview of your rotated sprite sheet. You can change
any settings and press enter again to redo the image.

Settings save every time you press 'enter' so if you
need to rotate several objects with the same settings 
it will be pretty simple.

Simply click 'save' to save the new image with the 'exportname' 
filename. Make sure you pressed "enter" while the save dialog
box was highlighted - or else you may get an output named
'.png' (no filename).

Supports .png format only.



If this software does not work for you, try updating your java. 

This was created on 64 bit Windows 7, so compatibility for other
